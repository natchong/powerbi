# powerbi
A performance report for a plant company in the year of 2023 and 2024. 
Structure:
1. Data: where I did power query from the data file in the form of excel. Cleaned up data format such as removing duplicates & null values. Changed some column names and removed unneccessary ones. Transform the data from excel to powerbi desktop. Created a new column for dates including dates for comparison ( YearToDate and PriorYearToDate ). Built virtual tables for GP, Sales and Quantity as the headers as well as YTD and PYTD. Also, organise all the data query into display folders.
2. Model: Did measures and calculated column. Needed a header as the title as well as few tables in the headers to show important data from the performance report such as GP, Sales. Created a country table to show 10 countries with the most decline in sales and profit in the selected year. Created a table for GP according to month, country and product. Created a table for GP by motnh and compared to PYTD. Created a table for account profitability GP%.
3. Visuals: Layout made clean and organised. Design such as colours and format of fonts to increase attractability.
